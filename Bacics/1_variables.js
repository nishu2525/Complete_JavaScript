/*
Console is  used to print / (log) any msg to console 
Console.log alway writes in next line.

Variables

Variables are containers for data Inside it we store there value.
Js is Dynamically typed language

To store we need memory space.
So we create variables.
Const →value can't be changed.

In maths a=b  is valued of a and b is equals
But in programming 
a=b is 
 store whatever value of b in a 
that's why we call it as assignment operator


Rutes for variable Names

1)Variable names are case sensitive
 2) only letters, digits, $, -  are allowed.

3) we can't eg:- use digits at starting of word 
eg-- 25Nishad
 It will not show an error 
4) keywords Can't be variables.

*/

const n1="Nishad";
const n2="Vaidu";
const n3="Umap";
const n4="Nishu";
 console.log(n1) ;
 console.log(n2) ;
 console.log(n3) ;
 console.log(n4) ;
 /*
If you  want to log multiple things at a time .
Dont use
*/
// → Just do
console.table([n1,n2,n3,n4]);
/*

Convensions (to be used for better practise not Compulsory but good to do so)

1.  Camelcase 1st-1word Small & 1st letter of 2nd  word Capital
eg:- nishadUmap

2. snake case 
→ Use understore ( _ ) betn two words.
eg:- nishad_umap

3.Kebabcase 
 Use hypen ( - ) betn two words 
eg: nishad-umap

4.Pascal Case 
first letter of both words capital.
eg:- NishadUmap

Recommended is  always use camel case 
Eg-  nishadUmap



Prefer Not to use var - bcz of issue in block  scope & functional Scope.

Never Declare avriable alone
eg- name="Nishad"; X
let name="Nishad"; ✓
If you don't define any value of variable then you'll get 
undefined

before 2015  var was Only datatype in JS, after that in  ES6 (Ecma Script 6)
{new in version -6} 
New Datatypes are declared so now using var is not good. 


 let, const, var

var - Variable can be redeclared & updated, global scope variable.

let: Variable can't be redeclared but can be updated , block scope variable.

Const: Variable can't be rederlared or updated.A block scope variable.

Bydefault  in js when we declare a variable without assigning  valve, it will be returned as undefined.
